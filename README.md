For this coding test, we’d like you to build out the above interface as a ReactNative application.

The app should allow a user to view a list of tiles with an image, title and a label

The app should click through to the details view screen that should contain a hero image, title, opening times and larger details snippet.

You should:

* Use ReactNative.
* Demonstrate handling data through API calls. Faking this is fine for the purposes of this demonstration.
* Allow the user to click from feed to details
* Alter the design as needed to leave your mark
